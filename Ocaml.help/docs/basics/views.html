<h2> Opening Views </h2>

<p>

When you open the OCaml perspective for the first time, all the most useful views are automatically opened for you.
That includes the following views:
<ul>
<li>Problems
<li>Ocaml Toplevel
<li>Ocaml Compiler Output
<li>Console
<li>Error Log
</ul>

But you can choose to open other views or close some views that are not useful to you. 

<p>

If you want to open or reopen a view, click on <b>Window &gt; Show View</b> and select the view you
want to open. If the view you're looking for is not available in this menu, click on <b>Other...</b>
to open a window which shows all the views available in Eclipse.

You can also reset the OCaml perspective to its default layout at any moment by clicking on 
<b>Window &gt; Reset Perspective</b> in the main menu while the OCaml 
perspective is open.
