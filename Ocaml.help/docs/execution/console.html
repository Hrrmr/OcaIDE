<h2> Using the console </h2>

<p>


Once you have started an OCaml executable
(as explained in <a href="run_exe.html">Running an OCaml executable</a>),
you can see the output of your program in the <b>Console</b> view:

<p>

<img src="screens/console.png" alt="console">

<p>

You can also give input to your program by directly typing inside this console.

<p>

You also have buttons in this view's toolbar to kill the program, clear the console, 
prevent it from scrolling, remove terminated programs, etc.
