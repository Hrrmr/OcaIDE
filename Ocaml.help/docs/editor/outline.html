<h2> The Outline </h2>

<p>

The outline is used to have an overview of all the definitions in the file currently edited,
and to allow you to jump to a definition by clicking on it.

<p>

The outline synchronizes both ways: if you change the text caret position, the element
selected in the outline will change too.

<p>

When you compile a file with the "-dtypes" option, the type of each element will also appear in the outline.

<p>

<b>Note: </b>if there are syntax errors in your code, the outline tries to display the elements
that are valid, but in some cases it might not be able to do so.
