<h2> Code formatter </h2>

<p>

The OCaml plug-in includes a code formatter for module files. You trigger it 
by clicking on <b>Ocaml &gt; Format</b> or by pressing the <b>F3</b> key
(configurable in the key preferences).

<p>

If several lines are selected in the editor, only those lines will be reformatted.
Otherwise, the whole contents of the editor will be reformatted.

<p>

This formatter does the following:
<ul>
<li> Indentation based on nesting level
<li> Spacing between words (variables, separators, etc.)
<li> Wrapping of long comments
<li> Merging of consecutive small comments
<li> Deleting of redundant blank lines
</ul>

<p>

If you want to protect a comment from the formatter (for example if you have made
some ASCII-art), start your comment with <b>(*|</b> instead of <b>(*</b>. Ocamldoc comments
are never modified by the formatter.

<p> 

<b>Note:</b> Make the difference between this formatter and the automatic indentation
provided by the editor (see <a href="indentation.html">Indentation</a>). The automatic
indentation happens as you enter code for the first time, whereas the code formatter
is called on existing code.
