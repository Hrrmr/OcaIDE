<h2> Help on expected parameters </h2>

<p>

Right after you enter an element in the editor using completion (see <a href="completion.html">Completion</a>),
an information pop-up appears to show the parameters expected by the function, constructor or exception you
just entered.

<p>

<img src="screens/paramHelp.png" alt="help on expected parameters">

<p>

This pop-up is automatically hidden when it is no longer necessary (when the cursor in the editor gets out of
the lexical scope in which it is defined). <br>
You can also close it manually by hitting the <b>Escape</b> key.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> This feature uses the interface definition of the element. So, for it to work, the element
must be defined in an interface accessible from the paths you defined 
(see <a href="../basics/paths.html">Configuring paths</a> and
<a href="../compiling/paths.html">Configuring project paths</a>).
