<h2> Preprocessing files with Camlp4 </h2>

<p>

You can preprocess a file in the editor with camlp4 by putting a special comment
at the top of each file to be preprocessed: 
<p>
<code>(* pp: &lt;params&gt; *)</code>
<p>
where <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> are the parameters to be passed to camlp4.

<p>

For example, add <code>(* pp: -parser OcamlRevised *)</code> on the first line
of a module or interface file which is written using OCaml revised syntax.

<p>

This feature allows the outline, hyperlinks, module browser and code completion to
work correctly with files written with a syntax different from the standard OCaml
syntax.

<p>

You can add parsers and filters as parameters, but you mustn't add a printer, as
the printer is already added automatically.

<p>

<b>Note 1:</b> preprocessing files is very slow compared to the integrated parser, so
prefer the original syntax when possible.

<p>
 
<b>Note 2:</b> the comment is interpreted by OcaIDE, but not by the OCaml compiler. You must
still pass the right preprocessing options to the OCaml compiler.
 
<p>
 
<b>Note 3:</b> the comment must fit on a single line (no multi-line preprocessing comments)
