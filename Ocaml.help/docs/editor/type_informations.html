<h2> Type informations </h2>

<p>

The OCaml compiler provides the "-dtypes" command line option to make it display
the types it inferred for all the elements in the files it was asked to compile.

<p>

The OCaml plug-in uses this functionality to show the types in pop-ups when you
hover the mouse over an element in the editor:

<p>

<img src="screens/dtypes.png" alt="dtypes informations">

<p>

For it to work, the current file must be compiled with the "-dtypes" option, and
mustn't have been modified since the last time it was compiled.

<p>

The "-dtypes" option is automatically put on <b>OCaml Managed Projects</b>, and
is defined in the <b>OCaml Makefile Projects</b>, but you have to set it manually
if you are using an <b>OCaml Empty Makefile Project</b>.
