<p>

To make the debugger stop at a defined position in your program, you can
put a breakpoint at this position. To do so, place the text caret at
the position you want the breakpoint to be in the editor, and 
click on <b>Debug &gt; Put Breakpoint</b> (the debugger must be started
for this to work, see <a href="start.html">Starting the debugger</a>).

<p>

If you want to delete all breakpoints, click on <b>Debug &gt; Remove Breakpoints</b>.
 
<p>

You can also see the breakpoints you defined and delete them selectively in the
<b>Ocaml Breakpoints</b> view:
