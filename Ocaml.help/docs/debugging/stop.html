<h2> Stopping the debugger </h2>

<p>

To stop debugging a program, stop it by clicking on the red button in the toolbar 
( <img src="screens/terminate_button.png" alt="terminate button"> ), or click on
<b>Debug &gt; Terminate</b>.

<p>

This will switch you back to the main OCaml perspective. Do not switch the perspective
manually, as this would leave the debugger and the program running.  

<p>

<b>Note: </b> Do NOT click on the terminate button in the console, under normal circumstances,
as this would kill the debugged process directly, instead of asking the debugger to terminate.
