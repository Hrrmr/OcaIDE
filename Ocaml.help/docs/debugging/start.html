<h2> Starting the debugger </h2>

<p>

To start debugging a byte-code executable (the OCaml debugger doesn't work
on native executables), right-click on it in the navigator view, and select
<b>Debug As &gt; Ocaml Executable</b>:

<p>

<img src="screens/start.png" alt="starting the debugger">

<p>

This will open the <b>OCaml Debug perspective</b>, which provides a view layout
designed for debugging OCaml executables.

<p>

When you start the debugger, the program is loaded into memory,
but the execution of the program has not started yet. To start it,
see <a href="step.html">Stepping</a>.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> Do not switch manually to the OCaml Debug perspective, as this would not
start the debugger.
