<h2> Linking external files </h2>

<p>

If your project is an <b>OCaml Managed Project</b> and you make use of external files (for example
the Unix module), you must specify which object files to link with each mli file, so that the
OCaml compiler can link it correctly.

<p>

For this, when you compile a project which uses external files, a new folder called "External files"
is created at the root of your project. For each interface (mli) file that appears in this
folder, you must configure the object file(s) to link with it by right-clicking on the interface (mli file)
in the navigator view, selecting <b>Properties</b>, selecting the <b>Ocaml External File</b> section,
and adding each object file needed by the OCaml linker (they are usually found in the OCaml library).
