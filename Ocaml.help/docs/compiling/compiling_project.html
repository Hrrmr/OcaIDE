<h2> Compiling an OCaml project </h2>

<p>

There are several ways to compile an OCaml project depending on the project type 
and on the options you set:
<ul>
<li> If <b>Project &gt; Build Automatically</b> is checked, saving a modified file will
trigger a recompilation of the project. So, to force a file to recompile, you can modify it
(adding and then removing a space for example) and save it.
<li> If <b>Project &gt; Build Automatically</b> is not checked, you can compile a project by selecting 
the project in the navigator view and then clicking on <b>Project &gt; Build Project</b>, or by
right-clicking on the project in the navigator view and clicking <b>Build Project</b> in the
context menu. The project will only be rebuilt if one of its files was modified.
<li> You can force a full recompilation of a project by cleaning it 
(see <a href="../projects/clean.html">Cleaning a project</a>).
<li> For an <b>OCaml Makefile Project</b> or an <b>OCaml Empty Makefile Project</b>, right-click
on the project in the navigator view, and select <b>Make Project</b> (the Makefile targets must
be correctly configured, see <a href="makefile_targets.html">Configuring Makefile targets</a>)
</ul>

<p>

When the project is compiled, the <b>OCaml Compiler Output</b> view is updated with
the messages returned by the tools called to build the project
(ocamlc, ocamlopt, make, ...):
