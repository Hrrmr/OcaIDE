<h2> Top-level </h2>

<p>

This OCaml plug-in for Eclipse includes an interface to the OCaml top-level, which is
mainly used for testing code quickly. To open it, click on 
<b>Window &gt; Show View &gt; OCaml Toplevel</b>.

<p>

<p>

The top-level view is divided in two panels, which you can resize by moving the splitter which
separates them. The top panel displays the output of the OCaml top-level, and the bottom panel
is used to enter expressions.

<p>

To evaluate an expression, type it in the bottom panel, and press <b>Enter</b> (the expression must
end with two semi-colons, and the text caret must be at the end of the expression when
you type <b>Enter</b>).

<p>

You can edit text (using the arrow keys) before sending it to the top-level, 
unlike with the OCaml text-mode top-level.

<p>

You can also recall previously edited expressions by using the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow
keys, or the <b>F3</b> and <b>F4</b> function keys when the expression spans several lines.

<p>

You can interrupt the computation at any moment by either clicking on the red button in the
toolbar, or by hitting <b>Ctrl + C</b> (this does not work on Windows).

<p>

You can also use the toolbar buttons to clear the output, reset the top-level, or open a new 
top-level.

<p>

There is a shortcut which allows you to quickly send an expression from the code editor to the
top-level. To activate it, select an expression in the OCaml code editor and click on
<b>OCaml &gt; Eval In Toplevel</b> or hit the <b>F6</b> key (by default; this key can be
changed in the preferences). 

<p>

There is also a shortcut to load a compiled module into the top-level: right-click on the module
(.ml file) in the navigator and select <b>Load in Toplevel</b> (note: this only works with byte-code
modules). 

<p> 

<b>Hint:</b> Use topfind (from the 
<a href="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/findlib.html">findlib library</a>) to easily
load libraries into the top-level.
