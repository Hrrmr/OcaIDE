<h2> Cleaning a project </h2>

<p>

Cleaning a project can be useful when you want to get rid of object files (cmo, cmx, ...), or when
you want to force your project to be recompiled from scratch.

<p>

To clean a project, click on <b>Project &gt; Clean</b>:

<p>

You should then get this dialog box:

<p>

<img src="screens/clean2.png" alt="">

<p>

You can choose to clean all the projects in your workspace (which can take a lot of time), or a
selection of projects. If the <b>Start a build immediately</b> checkbox is checked, the projects
will be immediately rebuilt after being cleaned. 

<p>

<b>Hint:</b> There is a shortcut for cleaning a project when a file from this project is being
edited: click on <b>Ocaml &gt; Clean</b>. 

<p>

<b>Hint 2:</b> You can also clean an <b>Ocaml Makefile Project</b> (or <b>Ocaml Empty Makefile Project</b>)
by right clicking on the project in the navigator and selecting <b>Clean Project</b>.
This action will always clean the project without rebuilding it, no matter what the state of the 
<b>Project &gt; Build Automatically</b> checkbox.
