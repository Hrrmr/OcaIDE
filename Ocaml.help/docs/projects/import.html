<h2> Importing a project </h2>

<p>

To import an existing OCaml project, first start by creating a new project to import it into 
(see <a href="new_project.html">Creating a new project</a>). 
If the project you want to import has a Makefile, create an "OCaml Empty Makefile Project". 
If it doesn't, create an "Ocamlbuild Project" or "OCaml Managed Project".

<p>

Then, right-click in the navigator on the project you just created, and select <b>Import...</b>

Check the boxes near the files you want to import, and uncheck those for the files you don't want to import
into your project. Then, click <b>Finish</b>.
