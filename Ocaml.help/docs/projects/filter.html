<h2> Filtering the navigator contents </h2>

<p>

You can use filters to choose which file types you want to see in the navigator,
and which ones you want to hide.

<p>

By default, all the OCaml object files are hidden, so that they won't
clutter the view, along with some files and directories used internally by the OCaml plug-in.

<p>

If you want to change that default, click on the little arrow in the navigator's toolbar,
and select <b>Filters...</b>

Then, in the dialog that appears, check the boxes corresponding to the file types you want to hide,
or uncheck the boxes for those you want to be visible.
