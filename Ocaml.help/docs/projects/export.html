<h2> Exporting a project </h2>

<p>

If your project doesn't have a Makefile, you might want to create one before exporting it,
so that it can be compiled easily outside of Eclipse.

<br>

To do that, right-click on your project, and select <b>Generate Makefile</b> in the pop-up menu
(this step is optional):

<p>

Then, you can clean your project before exporting it, to get rid of useless files. <br>
If it is checked, uncheck the <b>Build Automatically</b> option in the <b>Project</b> menu.<br>
Then, click on <b>Clean...</b> in the <b>Project</b> menu.
  
<p>

You should get the following window:

<p>

<p>

Click on <b>Clean projects selected below</b>, and check only your project.<br>
Uncheck the <b>Start a build immediately</b> checkbox, so that the project doesn't regenerate
its files right after you cleaned them. <br>
Then, click <b>OK</b>.



<p>

Now that your project is ready to export, right-click on it in the navigator view 
and select <b>Export...</b>

<p>

<p>

In the following dialog box, select <b>File System</b> under the <b>General</b> category, and click <b>Next</b>.

<p>

<p>

Then, you should get the following dialog box:

<p>

<img src="screens/export3.png" alt="">

<p>

Check the boxes near the files you want to export, and uncheck those for the files you don't want to export. 
For example, you might want to uncheck the ".settings", "External files" and ".DebuggerSourceLookup" folders, 
as well as the ".paths", and ".project" files, which are used internally in the plug-in, 
but are not useful in an exported project.

<p>

Enter the path of the folder you want to export your project to (or click <b>Browse...</b> and
select it), then click <b>Finish</b>.

<p>

Then, you can re-enable the <b>Build Automatically</b> checkbox you had disabled at the beginning.
