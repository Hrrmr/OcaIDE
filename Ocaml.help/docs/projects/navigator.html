<h2> The Navigator </h2>

<p>

The navigator view is used to manage your projects and files, in a hierarchical view. 

<p>

Here is the navigator on an example workspace:

<p>

<img src="screens/navigator.png" alt="The navigator view">

<p>

In this example, we have three projects. The first project is an <b>OCaml Managed Project</b>, the
second project is an <b>OCaml Makefile Project</b>, and the third project is closed. You can notice
that projects have different icons depending on their type. 

<p>

In the second project, we have a module (a.ml) and its interface (a.mli), a bytecode executable 
(the "B" icon indicates this is a bytecode executable), an ocamllex file (lexer.mll), an ocamlyacc
file (parser.mly), an html file (doc.html), a makefile and the generic makefile (OCamlMakefile),
and a folder which contains a module file (b.ml).   


<p>

You use the navigator to:
<ul>
<li>Create new resources (projects, files and folders)
<li>Move and rename resources
<li>Delete resources
<li>Import or export resources
<li>Share resources on a content versioning system
<li>Change resource properties
<li>Compare resources with each other (diff)
<li>Start running or debugging executables
<li>Restore a file to a previous version
<li>Close or re-open a project
<li>Change project properties
<li>...
</ul> 

To open a contextual menu on a resource, right-click on it (or <b>Ctrl + Click</b> on a Mac).
