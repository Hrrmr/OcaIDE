* 1.0.0:
	* First public release (version 1.0.0)

* 1.0.1:
    * fixed some bugs
    * added a compatibility option (in the preferences) to disable Unicode characters which can cause problems on some systems (namely Windows...)
    * added options to enable or disable displaying of types in the outline, editor popups, and editor's status bar.
    * modified the install to unpack the plug-in's jar after installation, because Windows couldn't find some image resources in the jar file (although this worked on other systems)
    * changed the generated "makefile" file in Makefile Projects to "Makefile" (capitalized) 
    
* 1.0.2:
    * Plug-in is compiled with Java 1.5 compatibility options again (I forgot it in 1.0.1, sorry!). This should fix "Bad version number in .class file" errors.
    * Toplevel process now inherits parent environment
    * Fixed a bug in "Load in Toplevel" action under Windows 
    
* 1.0.3:
    * This update fixes (hopefully!) the Java 1.5 compatibility problems. The previous version still wasn't compatible with Java 1.5 due to a bug (feature?) in the Eclipse plug-in build system: the plug-in was always built using the general settings instead of the project-specific ones.
    * The plug-in is no longer unpacked on install, since the bug which prevented loading of icons from the jar on Windows has been fixed. 

* 1.0.4
	* Fixed a bug with hyperlinks that happened when a definition had the same name as one in Pervasives
	* Completion proposals can now look in linked resources (patch submitted by Gregory)
	* Syntax coloring now works correctly with comments inside strings inside comments and ocamldoc comments (strings must be terminated inside comments in Ocaml)
	* "unexpected end of line" syntax error now appears at the end of the file instead of the beginning
	* changed the formatter so that it doesn't add a space before a colon, since that can cause naming labels to become incorrect ("~a:1" became "~a : 1")
	* added a preference page for the formatter
	* added a preference page for filtering the contents of the outline
	* added a preference page for the debugger 
	* updated OcamlMakefile (generic makefile) to the latest version
	* added "/bin" (on a Unix system, if it exists) and the Ocaml library path to the makefile paths of a new makefile project
	* fixed a bug that caused the whole interface to freeze while the outline was being rebuilt
	
* 1.0.5
	* fixed a bug that caused the debugger to get stuck when the executable being debugged was killed
	* completion box now automatically closes after typing a space
	* added a facility to change all the paths at once in the paths preference page
	* added an option to always expand some elements in the outline (modules, classes)
	* added an option (both in the preferences and in the outline toolbar) to always fully expand the outline
	* fixed a bug in the parser with complex patterns in 'let in' expressions
	* added editing support for ml4 files (but no parser and no outline)    
	
* 1.0.6
	* hyperlinks now find renamed modules in current module
	* hyperlinks now work correctly with definitions like: "let a = 2;; let a = a in let a = a in a;;" 
	* modified the paths preference page to make it more intuitive
	* added an option to "unnest" "let in" definitions (activated by default)
	* added "while" and "begin end" templates 
	* improved outline speed
	
* 1.0.7
	* Completion, hyperlinks, and the module browser are now based on the new parser (major refactoring)
	* Drastic speed-up of hyperlinks which open other modules
	* Tweaked the 'unnest in' option, and corrected a bug which caused definitions to appear out of order.
	* Split the outline preference page into two pages, because it was too long.
	* Fixed a bug with definitions that appeared several times in the outline when the code was not syntactically correct.
	* Fixed a bug with syntax coloring of ocamldoc comments
	* If the debugger doesn't want to exit after clicking on "terminate", a second click on the "terminate" button will kill it, together with the debugged process
	* Added an option (for the editor) to automatically add the closing double-quote
	* "Convert revised syntax to standard syntax" and "Format with camlp4" actions now display the potential error message
	* Definitions cache now uses soft references
	* Added an option to not display 'and' definitions in blue in the outline
