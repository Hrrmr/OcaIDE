<h2> Creating executables </h2>

<p>

For <b>OCaml Makefile Projects</b>, the makefile determines how to create executables.
Here, we explain how to create executables in <b>OCaml Managed Projects</b>.

<p> 

To indicate that you want an executable to be created from a module file, right-click on 
this module file in the navigator view, select <b>Properties</b>, and select the
<b>Ocaml Module</b> section. You should get this dialog box:

<p>

Here, click on the <b>Make executable named</b> checkbox, and give the executable a
name in the associated text field.

<p>

There is also a way to choose multiple executables at once, by opening a project's properties
(by right-clicking on it, and selecting <b>Properties</b>) and choosing the <b>OCaml Project</b>
category:

<p> 

Here, you can choose which modules must become executables, by clicking on each one's 
corresponding checkbox.

<p>

This property page is also used to set the compilation mode: you can choose between <b>byte-code</b> and
<b>native</b> executables.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> In the navigator view, modules marked as executable will appear with the following icon:
