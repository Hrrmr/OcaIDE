<h2> Configuring Makefile targets </h2>

<p>

If your project is an <b>OCaml Empty Makefile Project</b>, you must tell the O'Caml plug-in
what Makefile targets it must use when calling the <b>make</b> command to build your project,
clean it, or create its documentation.

<p>

To do that, open the project properties by right-clicking on the project in the navigator and
selecting <b>Properties</b>, and then click on the <b>Makefile</b> category on the left.
You should get the following properties dialog:

<p>

<p>

There are three fields you can change:
<ul>
<li> rebuild target: specify the name of the makefile target that must be used
to compile the project (usually "all")
<li> clean target: specify the name of the makefile target that must be used
to clean the project (usually "clean")
<li> doc target: specify the name of the makefile target that must be used
to generate documentation for the project
</ul>

<p>

Any of these fields can contain several targets, separated by commas, that will be
called in the order they appear.

<p>

The correct names of the targets that must be used can usually be found in a README
or INSTALL file included with the project, or directly by analyzing the makefile itself.
