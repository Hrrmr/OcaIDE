<h2> Configuring project paths </h2>

<p>

Configuring the project paths is important, because the compiler and debugger rely on 
the paths to be correctly defined.

<p>

To open the project paths properties page, right-click on a project in the navigator, select
<b>Properties</b>, and then open the <b>Project Paths</b> section.

<p>

Normally, the current "." folder and the O'Caml library's folder should be in this list.
You should manually add all the folders in which the files used by your project can be found 
(this includes project sub-folders).

<p>

Each path can be either absolute or relative to the project.

<p>

The order of the paths is meaningful: if a file with the same name is found in two different
folders, the first one will be taken.

<p>

If your project is an <b>OCaml Makefile Project</b>, you should also configure the paths in the 
<b>Makefile Paths</b> section, which are the paths in which the Makefile is going to look to find
the tools it needs to compile your project. If you get a message like "command x not found" or similar
in the <b>Ocaml Compiler Output</b> view while trying to compile a Makefile project, try to find
the path of this command on your system and add it in the <b>Makefile Paths</b> properties page.
