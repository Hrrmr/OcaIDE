<h2> Using the generic Makefile </h2>

<p>

When you create an <b>OCaml Makefile Project</b>, two files are automatically created in this project:
"makefile" and "OCamlMakefile". "OCamlMakefile" is a generic Makefile that knows how to compile
complex projects, and "makefile" imports "OCamlMakefile", and is used to specify the list of files
you want to compile, the compilation mode (bytecode, executable), along with some options (generate
type annotations, ...).

<p>

You should modify "makefile" to reflect your project, whereas you normally would never modify
"OCamlMakefile". 

<p>

If you want to keep it simple, open "makefile" and just enter the names of 
the source files that must be compiled after "SOURCES =", in the right order, 
and enter the name of the executable you want to produce after "RESULT =".

<p>

If you want more information, refer to the official documentation for the OCamlMakefile project
at <a href="http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html#toc16">http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html#toc16</a>.
