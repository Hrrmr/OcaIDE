<h2> Compiler Options </h2>

<p>

This page explains how to set the compiler options on <b>OCaml Managed Projects</b>.
For <b>OCaml Makefile Projects</b>, see 
<a href="makefile_targets.html">Configuring Makefile targets</a>.<br>
For <b>Ocamlbuild projects</b>, configure the ocamlbuild targets, the libraries,
the compiler flags and the linker flags in the project properties page, under
the section named <b>Project</b>. 


<p>

To configure the compiler options that must be applied to a module, right-click
on the module in the navigator view, and select properties. 
Then, select the <b>OCaml Module</b> category:

<p>

In this properties page, you can add compilation flags by typing a flag in the 
text field and clicking <b>Add</b>. You can also remove, change and reorder flags
by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

<p>

You must enter the flags as you would on the command line, but without spaces.
For example, the "-w a" flag (to disable all warnings) must be split in two: "-w" and
"a".  

<p>

You can also add some global compiler flags that will be applied to each module in the project,
by opening the project properties page (right-click on a project in the navigator, then
select properties), and selecting the <b>OCaml Build Flags</b> section:
