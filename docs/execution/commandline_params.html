<h2> Configuring command-line parameters </h2>

<p>

You can configure the parameters to pass to your executable on the command-line by opening
the launch configuration dialog, by right-clicking on the executable, and selecting
<b>Run As &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b> or by clicking on <b>Run &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b> 
in the main menu.

<p>

You should get the following dialog:

<p>

<p>

If you have already run the executable once (as explained in 
<a href="run_exe.html">Running an O'Caml executable</a>), a launch configuration
has already been created for you: click on it in the right panel. If not,
create it now by right-clicking on <b>OCaml Executable</b> and selecting <b>New</b>.
If you create a launch configuration manually, you must also specify the project name
and the full path to the executable.

<p>

Then, you can enter your command-line parameters, separated by spaces. You can use
spaces in arguments by quoting them (with " "), and you can include double-quotes
by escaping them with the "\" character.
