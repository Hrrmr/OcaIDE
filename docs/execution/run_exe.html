<h2> Running an O'Caml executable </h2>

<p>

Once you have created an executable 
(see <a href="../compiling/create_exe.html">Creating executables</a>),
you can execute it by right clicking on it in the navigator view (it should appear
with the <img src="screens/bytecode_icon.png" alt="byte-code icon"> icon if it is
a byte-code executable, or with the <img src="screens/native_icon.png" alt="native icon">
icon if it is a native executable), and selecting <b>Run As &gt; Ocaml Executable</b>. 

<p>

<p>

Actually, this is a launch shortcut that automatically creates a launch configuration for you, 
and runs it.
But you can also create a launch configuration manually by clicking on 
<b>Run &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b> in the main menu.

<p>

You also use this dialog to configure the command-line parameters 
(see <a href="commandline_params.html">Configuring command-line parameters</a>).
