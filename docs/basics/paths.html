<h2> Configuring Paths </h2>

<p>
First, if it is not already done, start by installing the latest 
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html">O'Caml distribution</a>
on your system.<br> 
OcaIDE has been designed to work with O'Caml 3.10 (everything should also work with
O'Caml 3.09, except ocamlbuild projects, the camlp4 formatter and camlp4 converter).

<p>

For OcaIDE to work, the paths of the O'Caml tools must be set correctly in the preferences. 
The plug-in tries to detect these paths automatically, but you should check that the detected paths
are the correct ones for your installation. If you have several O'Caml installations on your system,
you should give the paths to the version you want to use.   
 
<p>

To open the paths preferences, click on <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> 
(or <b>Eclipse &gt; Preferences</b> on Mac), then open the <b>Ocaml</b> subsection in the tree
and select <b>Paths</b>.
