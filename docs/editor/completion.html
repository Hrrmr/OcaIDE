<h2> Completion </h2>

<p>

Code completion is available in the O'Caml modules and interfaces editor.<br>

<p>

To activate it, type <b>Ctrl + Space</b> (by default). You will get a list of completion
propositions available in the current context.

<p>

For example, if you type an uppercase "B" in an empty module file and then hit <b>Ctrl + Space</b>,
you will get the following completion box, showing all the modules starting with a "B": 

<p>

<p>

You can then continue to type to further narrow down the list of propositions. You can also
select a proposition by using the <b>Up</b>, <b>Down</b>, <b>Page Up</b>, <b>Page Down</b>, or 
by clicking on it. 

<p>

Each time you select a proposition, the help pop-up on the right
changes to reflect your selection, by displaying useful informations on the selected element
extracted from the interface (mli) file in which this element is located.

<p>

Once the element you were looking for is selected, type <b>Enter</b> to insert it into 
the editor at the current position. You can also double-click on the element to insert it. 

<p>

In our example, this would insert the word "Buffer" into the editor.

<p>

Then, if we type a "." (period), we get a list of members found inside the "Buffer" module:

<b>Note:</b> for completion to work, the path of the O'Caml standard library
must be defined in the preferences (see <a href="../basics/paths.html">Configuring paths</a>),
along with the paths used in the project (see <a href="../compiling/paths.html">Configuring project paths</a>).
