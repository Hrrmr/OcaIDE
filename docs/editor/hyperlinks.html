<p>

Click on a variable, function, type constructor, etc. to jump to its definition. 

<p>

Click on the name of a module in an "open" directive to open the corresponding interface in a new editor. 

<p>

<b>Note:</b> for hyperlinks between modules to work, the project paths must be configured
(see <a href="../compiling/paths.html">Configuring project paths</a>).  

<p>

<b>Note:</b> Start by pressing <b>Ctrl</b> (or <b>Command</b>) and hover over the element. The link can take
some time (several seconds) to appear the first time when hyperlinks are not yet initialized.
