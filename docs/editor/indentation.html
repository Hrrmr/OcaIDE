<h2> Indentation </h2>

<p>

The O'Caml editor indents code automatically as you type it, by using a set of simple rules
based on the O'Caml syntax. For example, when you type <b>Enter</b> the end of the line
is analyzed to determine if the next line must be indented. 

<p>

You can also use the <b>Tab</b> key at the beginning of a line to indent it, 
and the <b>Shift + Tab</b> key combination to dedent. 

<p>

If you want to indent or dedent several lines at once, select them first and then 
use <b>Tab</b> or <b>Shift + Tab</b>.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> the <b>Tab</b> key is also used for inserting the "-&gt;" characters when
it is used in the middle of a line, to insert the "[]" characters after "::" 
or to complete "fn" into "function".
