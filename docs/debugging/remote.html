<h2> Debugging remote programs </h2>

<p>

You can debug O'Caml programs that are running on another computer with OcaIDE.
The debugger opens a port on your machine and acts as a server, that receives
connections from the debugged program running remotely.

<h3> Prerequisites </h3>

The program to be debugged must have been compiled with the "-g" switch.

<p>

You must have two copies of the program: one on the machine it will run on, 
and one in your workspace on your development machine where it will be debugged.

<h3> Starting a remote debugging session </h3>

To start a remote debugging session, create an OCaml launch configuration on your 
<i>development machine</i> running OcaIDE:
<ul>
<li>Go to <b>Run &gt; Open Debug Dialog...</b>
<li>Create a new OCaml Executable configuration, or open an existing one.
<li>Select <b>Enable remote debugging</b>.
<li>Specify a port number (e.g., 8000) in <b>Remote port</b>. 
This port must not be used by another application on your system. 
</ul>

<p>

Then, start the debugger:

right-click on the executable in the navigator view, and select
<b>Debug As &gt; Ocaml Executable</b>:

<p>

<p>

<p>

A dialog will appear:

<p>

<p>

At this point, OcaIDE will wait for you to start your remote program, 
while listening for an incoming connection on the port you specified 
(if you change your mind at this point, simply hit the "Cancel" button).


<h3>Starting the remote program</h3>

On the remote machine, do the following:

<ul>
<li> Set the "CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET" environment variable to "&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;", where:
<ul>
	 <li> host is the domain name or IP address of your development machine running OcaIDE
     <li> port is the port you specified in the launch configuration
</ul>

<li>Start your program

</ul>

For example, the following syntax will work for Bash:
<pre>CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET=devmachine:8000 ./name_of_prog</pre>

Where "devmachine" is the domain name of your development machine, and
8000 is the port the debugger is listening on.

<p>

On Windows, do <b>Start menu &gt; execute</b> and type cmd<br>
Then, do:<br>
<pre>SET CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET=devmachine:8000</pre>
<pre>name_of_prog</pre>

<p>

This will open the <b>O'Caml Debug perspective</b>, and you can now debug
your remote O'Caml executable.

<p>

To stop the program, either hit the "terminate" button in the toolbar, or exit
the remote program on your remote machine.

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" summary="">
<TR>
   <TH>Problem</TH>
   <TH>Possible solution</TH>
<TR>
   <TD>Starting the remote program produces a "cannot connect to debugger" message</TD>
   <TD>This message is produced by ocamlrun, and it means that your remote program 
   cannot connect to the host and port you specified. Things to try:
   <ul>
         <li> Check that you set the "CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET" environment variable correctly.
         <li> Check that your remote machine can "ping" your development machine. 
         If not, check your network setup.
         <li> Try running "telnet devmachine port" from your remote machine. 
         You should be able to connect. If not, check your network setup.
    </ul>
    </td>
<TR>
   <TD>Starting the OcaIDE debugger produces a "Unable to start a remote 
   debugging session on port 8000, since that port is already in use...".</TD>
   <TD>
   <ul>
   <li> Another application is already using this port : try changing your port
   <li> This message may also appear if you run two debugging sessions in 
   quick succession, due to the operating system not recycling ports quickly enough. 
   Try changing your port, or wait for a few seconds and try again
   </ul>
   </TD>

<p>

When you start the debugger, the program is loaded into memory,
but the execution of the program has not started yet. To start it,
