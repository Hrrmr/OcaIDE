<h2> Automatically generated files </h2>

<p>

This section only concerns <b>O'Caml Managed Projects</b>. There are no automatically generated
files in the other project kinds.

<p>

The O'Caml plug-in makes the distinction between files you created manually, and files that
were automatically generated by a tool (such as the O'Caml compiler). 

<p>

The automatically generated files appear with a red outline in the navigator view:

<p>

For example, in this screenshot, the "a.mli" file was automatically generated, whereas the other
files were created or modified by the user.

<p>

You can always delete automatically generated files, they will be re-created by the compiler (immediately
if the <b>Build Automatically</b> option is checked in the <b>Project</b> menu).

<p>

<b>Caution</b>: if one of the files you created takes the appearance of an automatically generated
file, if you don't want it to be deleted you should immediately uncheck the <b>Build Automatically</b> option 
in the <b>Project</b> menu, open the file in an editor, modify it (so that it will be saved) and save it.<br>
If you fail to follow these steps, your file will be deleted the next time the project is recompiled.
