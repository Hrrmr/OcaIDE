<h2> Creating a new project </h2>

<p>

To create a new O'Caml project, right click (or <b>Ctrl + Click</b> on Mac) on empty space in the navigator view.
Alternatively, you can also click on <b>File > New</b>.

<p>

If you are in the O'Caml perspective (see <a href="../basics/perspective.html">Opening the O'Caml perspective</a>), 
you should see the following menu:

<p>

From this menu, you can choose between three different kinds of O'Caml projects:
<ul>
<li> <b>O'Caml Managed Project</b>: The building of your projects is managed by the plug-in. 
Use it for simple projects.
<li> <b>O'Caml Makefile Project</b>: The building of your projects is managed by a Makefile. A generic
Makefile is provided, so that you only have to specify some rules for your project to compile correctly.  
<li> <b>O'Caml Empty Makefile Project</b>: Use it when you want to import a project, and you don't need
the plug-in to generate a generic Makefile.
</ul>

<p>

Once you have clicked on one of the three project options, you get the following dialog box:

Type the name you want to give to your project (avoid spaces and special characters), and click <b>Finish</b>.
