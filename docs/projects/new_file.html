<h2> Creating source files and folders </h2>

<p>

To create a source file or folder in an existing O'Caml project 
(see <a href="new_project.html">Creating a new project</a>), 
right click (or <b>Ctrl + Click</b> on Mac) in the navigator view 
on a previously created O'Caml project (or folder inside this project).

Alternatively, you can also click on <b>File > New</b>.

<p>

If you are in the O'Caml perspective 
(see <a href="../basics/perspective.html">Opening the O'Caml perspective</a>), 
you should see the following menu:

<p>

From this menu, you can choose among the following resources to create:
<ul>
<li> <b>Module</b>: creates a new O'Caml module file ("ml" file)
<li> <b>Interface</b>: creates a new O'Caml interface file ("mli" file)  
<li> <b>Yacc</b>: creates a new O'Caml parser generator ("mly" ocamlyacc file)   
<li> <b>Lex</b>: creates a new O'Caml lexer generator ("mll" ocamllex file) 
<li> <b>File</b>: creates any file you want, use it to create text files, html files, xml files...  
<li> <b>Folder</b>: creates a folder inside your project
<li> <b>Other...</b>: opens a dialog box to choose which kind of resource to create 
</ul>

<p>

Once you have clicked on one of the options, you get the following dialog box:

<p>

<p>

Type the name you want to give to your new resource (avoid spaces and special characters), 
and click <b>Finish</b>. 

<p>

<b>Note</b>: If you chose to create one of the O'Caml file types, you don't have to type the
extension of the file, it will be automatically added for you.
